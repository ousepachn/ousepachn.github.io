# A quick look into the history of malayalam cinema.
Hi there fellow cinema enthusiast and (or) data geek!  I wanted to feature a post on the movie industry of my home state, Kerala.  Kerala is one of the tinier states in India, but that never stopped us from creating a larger than life cinema industry.  Along with all the coconuts, backwaters and fried fish, quality movies are also on the list of top10 things that the state has to offer.

Ever wondered how the malayalam movie industry shaped across time? From the 1920's to present day, the Malayalam Movie Industry has created over 4,500 movies.  Thats over 100 movies per year from the 1970s and over 150 movies per year since the 1990s.  If you dont know your Mohanlal's from your Mammooty's, this might be your chance.
