<p>Hi! Welcome to my little corner of the internet.  This page serves as repository of interesting ideas and projects that I wanted to work on.  It was never intended to be exposed to the greater web.  But now that you're here, please feel to look around.  
	
Hopefully, some of these projects are complete.  Hopefully, some of them are interesting and worth your time. </p>
	

<h2>About Myself</h2>

<p> An engineering grad who is passionate about telling stories through data.  Always found myself working at the intersection of data, product and storytelling, and I absolutely love this space .  Outdoor enthusiast, fried chicken sandwich connoisseur, off beat travel guide, self certified data geek and horribly bad D3js developer.  
	
	Ping me about data projects, product/project planning, career advice, camping guidance or for good fried chicken
